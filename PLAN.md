# Project Workflow

1. **User Inputs URL:**
    - User enters the website URL to be analyzed.

2. **Basic Checks:**
    - Check for common phishing indicators (e.g., unusual URL structure, suspicious domain name).
    - If any indicators are found, classify as phishing and stop.

3. **API Calls:**
    - Fetch domain information (Whois data, age, registrar).
    - Verify SSL certificate.
    - Check website content against Google Safe Browsing or VirusTotal.
    - Retrieve IP reputation information.

4. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Clean and format the data from API responses.
    - Extract relevant features (e.g., domain age, SSL certificate validity, website content keywords, IP reputation score).

5. **AI Model:**
    - Feed preprocessed data into a trained machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network).
    - Model analyzes the data and predicts whether the website is phishing or legitimate.

6. **Decision Making:**
    - If the model's confidence level is high, classify the website as phishing or legitimate.
    - If the confidence level is low, consider additional checks or human verification.

7. **Output:**
    - Display the result to the user (phishing or legitimate).
    - Provide detailed information about the detected threats (if applicable).
